# Code and Video of EASI: Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification for Sim-to-Real Transfer
 


This repository contains the code and video demonstrations of NeurIPS 2024 Conference Submission: EASI: Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification for Sim-to-Real Transfer. 

The code for various experiments is placed in different branches.
- Ant: ANtWasserstein
- Ballbalance: BallWasserstein
- Cartpole:  CartpoleWasserstein


For the sim-to-real experiments, we used the Unitree Go2 as the experimental platform.

 The introduction video for the experimental results can be found here at [Sim2Real Video](https://youtu.be/4Zz61-QDLOw).


This is a code repository that is still in the development phase. We will further improve the code's readability and  the code will be released to the public promptly after the paper's publication.
