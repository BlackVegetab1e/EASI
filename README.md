# Code and Video of EASI: Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification for Sim-to-Real Transfer
 


This repository contains the code and video demonstrations of NeurIPS 2024 Conference Submission: EASI: Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification for Sim-to-Real Transfer. 

The code for various experiments is in the corresponding named folder. This is a code repository that is still in the development phase. We will further improve the code's readability and  the code will be released to the public promptly after the paper's publication.

For the sim-to-real experiments, we used the Unitree Go2 as the experimental platform.
